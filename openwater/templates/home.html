        <p>
            Water quality isn't something we tend to think about, except when
            furiously de-scaling the kettle or dishwasher, but it's <strong>
            really quite important</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            For those of us on mains water, we just assume that water companies
            are adhering to regulations, and everything is fine. However, those
            using bore-holes and wells are always subject to ground water
            changes. Even when on mains water, there can be contamination, and
            this data isn't particularly visible, or updateable by the public.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>H2O Really?</strong> is here to provide an open data
            service through which water quality can be recorded, monitored, and
            reported on by anyone, with any available technology. We want all
            types of water quality indicators to be recorded, but even if you
            can only test the pH or make a casual observation about the water
            quality around you, we want to know about it!
